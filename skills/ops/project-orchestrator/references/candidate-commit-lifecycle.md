# Candidate commit lifecycle

Project-orchestrator v2 uses **additive immutable commits** on one Epic branch.

For each task:

1. coding/completion/deterministic checks pass in the Epic implementation worktree;
2. the controller stages only allowed product changes;
3. it creates one candidate commit;
4. it creates a detached review worktree at that exact SHA;
5. an independent reviewer approves or returns findings;
6. findings are applied by fix-agent in the Epic implementation worktree;
7. the controller creates a new additive `review-fix` commit;
8. the new branch HEAD receives a fresh detached review.

Never use `git commit --amend` after review begins. Previous candidate/fix SHAs remain durable
evidence and, in GitHub mode, are associated with task Issue + Epic identity.

A passing task becomes `ready_for_merge` but remains on the Epic branch. No task candidate is merged
to `main` independently.

After all tasks pass, one holistic Epic review evaluates the complete final HEAD against the Epic
contract and cross-task regressions. Holistic corrections are additive and invalidate the previous
holistic approval. Only the exact final reviewed SHA may reach `EPIC_READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.

GitHub mode then opens one final PR. Task commits contain non-closing `Issue:` / `Epic:` metadata;
`Closes` references appear only in the final PR. Final squash/merge is a separate explicit
`integrate` operation, after which local task contracts become `done`/archived.
