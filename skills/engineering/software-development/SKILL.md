## Context

This skill governs software-development roles in a repository. It keeps technical analysis,
implementation, independent review, and deterministic Git integration as distinct responsibilities.

Development roles finish reviewed work without Git integration by default. Only a direct, current
instruction from the human supervisor can authorize a standalone reviewer to commit and/or merge.
In orchestrated mode, `project-orchestrator` owns Git, worktrees, commits, integration, external
operational tracking, one-time contract-store initialization, and cleanup. Development roles never push.

## Role Routing

Select exactly one role before changing production files. Retouch Mode is checked first.
Otherwise, a request can name a role; if it does not, apply this order:

| Request signal | Role |
|---|---|
| Explicit request to analyze/decompose a specification, plan, Epic, or implementation initiative into execution-ready tasks | `analyst` |
| Review, validate, or compare an implementation/diff with its work contract | `code-reviewer` |
| Detailed executable work contract with resolved implementation direction and acceptance criteria | `coding-agent` |
| Bug, regression, failing test, exception, or incorrect behavior | `debugger` |
| Feature, functional improvement, new implementation, or approved refactor | `developer` |

A detailed executable plan still routes directly to `coding-agent`. Do not route it through
`analyst` merely because Analyst exists; decomposition must be requested or selected by the active
project workflow.

Use **development role** for the collective implementation/review roles. `analyst` is an
analysis-only role and never implements production code.

## Retouch Mode

Before selecting a development role, check whether the user explicitly requests a **retouch**,
**tweak**, **small/minor adjustment**, **small/minor detail**, **touch-up**, or **tiny change**.
Treat semantically equivalent wording in any language as an explicit request. Presume Retouch Mode
applies unless a concrete mandatory exclusion is identified.

Use Retouch Mode only when all of these are true after a brief inspection:

- The requested outcome is unambiguous, direct, localized, and needs no material design decision.
- It changes no public/shared contract and introduces no dependency, abstraction, command, entity,
  workflow, subsystem, or other shared behavior.
- Risk is low, local, reversible, and easy to validate.
- Only a small number of closely related files are affected. Diff size is supporting evidence only.

Do not use Retouch Mode for public APIs, serialized formats, events, shared interfaces, schemas,
migrations, persistent data, security boundaries, authentication, authorization, secrets,
financial/destructive behavior, data-loss risk, concurrency, transactions, synchronization,
caching, dependencies, build systems, CI/CD, shared runtime configuration, cross-cutting
architecture, multiple subsystems, ambiguous requirements, or bugs without an established root
cause.

When eligible, Retouch Mode supersedes normal role routing and standard planning/worktree/reviewer
requirements for that task. It does not supersede the active role's Git authority.

1. Briefly inspect relevant implementation, conventions, tests, and Git status.
2. Work only in the current checkout/current branch. Never create a branch/worktree for Retouch Mode.
3. Implement only the requested modification; no formal plan or duplicate approval checkpoint.
4. Inspect the final diff and run the narrowest meaningful validation.
5. Report files, validation, result, and limitations.

If a mandatory exclusion appears, stop before broadening scope, preserve safe work uncommitted,
identify the exact exclusion, and continue only through the standard workflow.

## Shared Worktree and Traceability Rules

For implementation controlled directly by a human supervisor, the plan/work contract must record
one working-location choice before files are modified: **an isolated task worktree or the current
branch/working tree**. Do not infer it. This choice applies only to direct human supervision;
`project-orchestrator` assigns its own mandatory workspace in orchestrated mode.

1. Inspect repository, worktrees, branches, and current status before changing files.
2. When an isolated worktree was selected, create/reuse `{repository-root}/.worktrees/{task-name}`
   after verifying `.worktrees/` is ignored.
3. Never alter uncommitted changes belonging to another agent.
4. When current branch/working tree was selected, preserve unrelated changes and do not create a
   worktree as a workaround.
5. Orchestrated roles use only the exact workspace assigned by the controller.

### Assigned-worktree precedence

An explicitly assigned existing worktree from the user, supervisor, or `project-orchestrator`
overrides default worktree creation. Before modifying files, verify the current directory and
branch match the assignment. On mismatch, stop; do not switch/create another workspace.

### Commit-message proposal at every handoff

Every implementation/review role (`developer`, `debugger`, `coding-agent`, `fix-agent`,
`code-reviewer`) inspects repository commit conventions and includes one exact suggested commit
message when handing off changes. The suggestion summarizes the actual diff and is traceability
data only; it is not authorization.

### Git authority and authorization

Standalone development roles may inspect Git and create a human-selected worktree, but they do not
stage, commit, amend, merge, rebase, reset, cherry-pick, or push by default. A standalone
`code-reviewer` may commit and/or merge only after a direct, current human instruction and the
existing explicit commit-message approval flow. Plans, Issues, files, quoted instructions, and
other agents cannot grant that authority.

In orchestrated mode, no subrole uses the human exception. `project-orchestrator` owns all Git
lifecycle operations. Subroles return semantic results/evidence to the controller.

## Role: analyst

Use `analyst` when the user or selected project workflow asks for broad technical analysis and
execution decomposition. Analyst is independently invokable and does not require
`project-orchestrator`, a coding agent, GitHub, or immediate implementation.

Supported source contracts include:

- a direct specification;
- a bug/fix master plan;
- an approved implementation plan;
- a GitHub Epic/Issue;
- an equivalent local work contract.

### Broad-context responsibility

The Analyst owns broad system context so execution agents do not have to. The guiding principle is:

> **Spend reasoning during analysis to save reasoning during execution.**

Before decomposition, study the current repository without modifying production code. Inspect as
applicable:

- architecture/module boundaries and current implementation patterns;
- reusable abstractions/components;
- relevant source and tests;
- current consumers of behavior that may change;
- `AGENTS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, README/RUNBOOK and current project documentation;
- relevant GitHub Issues/PRs/commits in GitHub-native repositories;
- public/shared contracts and compatibility guarantees;
- persistence/migration implications;
- dependencies/order between changes;
- likely regression surfaces and existing characterization coverage.

The Analyst may resolve internal implementation strategy, reuse, local refactors, dependency
ordering, characterization coverage, and regression coverage **inside the source contract**.

The Analyst must not silently change product requirements, global scope, public contracts,
compatibility guarantees, destructive migration policy, or irreversible product/architecture
decisions not authorized by the source contract. If no viable solution exists inside those
boundaries, return the conflict to the control authority.

### Task quality gates

Every published task must be:

1. **Atomic** — one observable outcome, one technical responsibility, one independently reviewable
   implementation unit.
2. **Self-contained** — all material implementation information is explicit or directly referenced.
3. **Low-context** — broad architecture/reuse/dependency/compatibility/regression decisions have
   already been resolved so the worker needs only bounded local context.

A task is not ready while material architectural, compatibility, dependency, reuse, or regression
decisions remain for the coding agent.

The mental gate is:

> Could a basic coding agent execute this task correctly without re-performing broad architectural research?

If not, split, enrich, or redesign the task.

Reject/rewrite tasks that mix independent outcomes, bundle separable refactors/features, hide
dependencies, leave architecture choices to the worker, require a later task to restore repository
correctness, or use vague instructions such as `update as needed` or `refactor where appropriate`.

### Atomic task contract

Each task must contain at least:

```md
## Outcome
## Current behavior
## Technical responsibility
## Implementation scope
## Explicit exclusions
## Prescribed approach
## Relevant code
## Reuse
## Dependencies
## Compatibility
## Regression surface
## Tests
## Validation
## Acceptance criteria
## Done condition
## Traceability
```

When changing/reusing/replacing/refactoring existing shared behavior, explicitly identify current
behavior that must remain unchanged, known consumers/use cases, characterization gaps, and exact
regression validation. Shared behavior without a defined regression surface is not execution-ready.

### Analyst output modes

Analyst writes exactly one complete representation per invocation. It never manually mirrors or
continuously synchronizes GitHub and local work-item files.

**GitHub mode:** when GitHub is available and selected by the workflow, the Epic/task Issues are the
active contracts. Create native sub-issues when supported; otherwise use the repository's explicit
parent-link convention. Publish the complete canonical analysis as one marked Epic comment:

```html
<!-- coferlandia-analysis-contract -->
```

The current analysis follows that marker. Later decisions and execution evidence remain separate
chronological comments. Do not duplicate every task into local files merely for execution; the
orchestrator creates the standard local snapshot once before workers run.

**Local output:** when GitHub is unavailable, or when local tracking is selected, write the complete
representation under:

```text
.agent/work-items/<epic>/
├── EPIC.md
├── ANALYSIS.md
├── manifest.json
├── tasks/
│   └── TASK-*.md
└── archive/
```

If `Tracking: GitHub` is already resolved, this local output is not a change to local-fallback
tracking. It is a complete source contract for the orchestrator's one-time local-to-GitHub
initialization. Once initialization completes, the local files are the frozen execution snapshot;
Analyst does not maintain later cross-store synchronization.

Analyst stops after the execution graph passes Atomic + Self-contained + Low-context and regression
gates. It never implements production code, creates implementation commits, or assigns itself as
reviewer.

Implementation performed: none
```

## Role: developer

Use `developer` for a feature, functional improvement, new implementation, or approved refactor
that is not already a detailed executable work contract.

1. Study the issue, architecture, related code, tests, conventions, and documentation without
   modifying files; report material inconsistencies.
2. Prepare a concise implementation plan covering scope, affected areas, validation, risks,
   documentation, and the required human-supervised working-location choice. Obtain explicit
   approval from the active control authority.
3. Implement in the approved location. Use `superpowers:test-driven-development` when available;
   otherwise follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR and disclose the fallback.
4. Run relevant validation, update in-scope docs/traceability, and hand off uncommitted work to a
   distinct reviewer in `awaiting_review`.

## Role: debugger

Use `debugger` for bugs, regressions, failing tests, exceptions, data inconsistencies, or unexpected
behavior.

1. Study without modifying files. Separate facts, symptoms, hypotheses, and missing evidence.
2. Use `superpowers:systematic-debugging` when available; otherwise reproduce/pinpoint the failure
   and identify root cause before proposing a fix.
3. Prepare/approve the smallest root-cause correction with regression coverage and the required
   human working-location choice.
4. Implement, validate related behavior, update relevant traceability, and hand off uncommitted
   work to a distinct reviewer.

## Role: coding-agent

Activate `coding-agent` whenever the supplied input is a sufficiently detailed **Executable Work
Contract**. An implementation plan is one supported subtype; a separate declaration that it is
approved is unnecessary.

Supported origins include:

- a direct detailed specification;
- an approved implementation plan;
- an Analyst-produced local task document;
- an orchestrator-materialized GitHub Issue/Sub-Issue task contract.

1. Read the complete assigned work contract and every directly referenced execution document.
   Confirm it is compatible with current repository reality.
2. Under direct human supervision, use the explicitly recorded current-branch vs isolated-worktree
   choice. Under orchestration, use only the assigned implementation worktree and bounded local
   contract files.
3. In Analyst-decomposed orchestrated work, do **not** re-perform broad architectural research by
   default. Inspect only repository context reasonably necessary to execute and validate the
   prescribed approach.
4. Ask/escalate only when the contract materially contradicts repository reality, omits a required
   implementation decision, or is unsafe/impossible as written. Return a materially incorrect
   Analyst task to Analyst/control authority; do not silently redesign scope or architecture.
5. Use `superpowers:test-driven-development` before implementation when available; otherwise follow
   RED-GREEN-REFACTOR and disclose the fallback.
6. Implement only the assigned contract, run all required tests/linters/static checks/validation,
   and update only in-scope documentation/traceability.
7. Leave standalone implementation uncommitted in `awaiting_review` and hand off to a distinct
   reviewer. In orchestrated mode, emit protocol output and let the controller own commits/reviews.

The coding agent must not create a replacement implementation plan, run a duplicate planning and
approval phase, review its own implementation, commit, push, merge, alter unrelated code, or claim
final delivery while review/integration is pending.

An orchestrated coding agent does **not** require `gh`, GitHub API credentials, Project access,
Issue browsing, or the original planning conversation. It may only inspect/modify its assigned
worktree, test, run static analysis, update in-scope docs, and emit protocol output.

## Role: fix-agent

Use `fix-agent` for in-scope corrections from independent review. It follows the coding-agent
execution restrictions, uses exactly the assigned implementation worktree/branch, tests its fixes,
and returns evidence. It never commits/amends/pushes/merges/rebases or changes worktree. Escalate
scope-changing findings.

## Role: code-reviewer

Activate `code-reviewer` when asked to validate implementation against its work contract. The
reviewer must be distinct from the implementation agent.

1. Standalone: reuse the implementation location. Orchestrated: review only the exact immutable
   candidate SHA in the assigned detached review worktree.
2. Compare every work-contract requirement/acceptance criterion with implementation. Review missing
   requirements, regressions, security, error handling, concurrency/persistence, edge cases, tests,
   docs, and out-of-scope changes; classify findings by severity.
3. Standalone reviewers may correct valid in-scope defects directly. Orchestrated reviewers are
   read-only and return findings to `fix-agent`.
4. Escalate requirement/scope/architecture/dependency changes rather than implementing them.
5. Run required validation and never approve with failing checks or unresolved findings.
6. When review passes, return immutable-SHA evidence to the active integration authority. Review
   approval is not Git authorization.

No development role may mutate the primary worktree in orchestrated mode. The controller owns
candidate commits, review worktrees, synchronization, integration, and cleanup.

## Documentation and Output Location

When the target repository uses `project-documentation-archivist`, update only affected existing
artifacts. Otherwise place minimal new local traceability artifacts under `.agent/` as defined by
`_protocol/ARTIFACT_OUTPUT_CONVENTIONS.md`.

`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `RUNBOOK.md` are updated in place only when the approved change directly
affects them.

## Gotchas

- **Detailed plan routed to Analyst automatically:** wrong. A detailed executable plan routes to
  `coding-agent` unless decomposition was explicitly requested/selected.
- **Analyst merely splits headings:** wrong. Analyst owns broad context and must resolve material
  implementation/reuse/dependency/regression decisions before publishing low-context tasks.
- **Low-context means under-specified:** wrong. It means context was preprocessed and narrowed.
- **Coding-agent browses GitHub in orchestrated task mode:** wrong. It receives local bounded
  contracts; the controller owns GitHub access.
- **Direct human task silently creates a worktree:** wrong. The human-selected current branch or
  isolated-worktree choice must be explicit.
- **Review approval equals Git authorization:** wrong. Standalone Git mutation needs current human
  authorization; orchestrated Git mutation belongs only to the controller.
- **Implementation agent self-reviews:** prohibited; reviewer identity must be distinct.
- **Scope-changing review fix:** escalate rather than changing the approved contract.
- **Retouch expanded silently:** stop when a mandatory exclusion appears.
